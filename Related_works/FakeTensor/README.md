- Experiment data [excel file](fake_tensor.xlsx)
- Figure showing the differences between fake tensor estimation and the actual GPU memory need of some of the models chosen randomly for being able to show them [figure in PDF format](ft_gb.pdf).
- Figure showing the distribution of the difference between GPU memory need and the estimation [figure in PDF format](difference_distribution.pdf)
- The python visualization code [python source](plotter.py)
