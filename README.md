This repository keeps all the artifact on our work on building an AI-based estimator for deep learning training tasks. For having an AI-based estimator, data is the integral part. So, the goal of the scripts producing different deep learning training tasks and monitoring them while training is the first important step in this journey. After getting the raw data, cleaning the data is the next step as the corresponding scripts can be found as well. Finally analyzing the datasets and producing insights based data, and training models, and trying different approaches is the next step.
